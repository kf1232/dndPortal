Notes:

- Use MERN stack
	- M: MongoDB / MySQL / MSSQL
	- E: Express (WebServer)
	- R: React 
	- N: Node
	
- Install NVM (Node version manager)
	- can easily switch between versions of Node/NPM (Major releases come preinstalled)
- Install PyENV
	- same as above
- Start using css modules
- Break out components into their own folder
	- UNLESS they are multiples of a specific kind of component
	- Refactor PointBuy, Custom, and Standard to use a common component for code that is similar between them

	- Use Axios to get your data from json server
- When you get around to doing authentication, use passport
	- Has handling for JWTs and OAuth
- Setup Jira for this project and connect with github
	- Make rules to connect your github repo to jira and link PRs/branches
- Write program to scrape 5e.tools to grab your data and update it

- I suggest using GraphQL as a middle layer between your frontend and your db/services
	- This is both a learning venture and a good practice for enterprise applications
	- Look up apollo boost or apollo client/server to get started
